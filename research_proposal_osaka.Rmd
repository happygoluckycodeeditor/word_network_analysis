This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

##Loading packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(tidytext)
library(widyr)

library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
```
##Loading the dataset
```{r}
user_reviews <- readr::read_csv('chihou_tweets_tokyo_translated.csv')
```
##Checking the dataset
```{r}
user_reviews
```
##Checking the data and it's duplication
```{r}
user_reviews %>% count(User, sort = TRUE)
```
##Checking the translated text
```{r}
user_reviews %>% head(10) %>% pull(English)
```
##Removing the date column as it is irrelavnt
```{r}
user_reviews <- user_reviews %>% select(-Date)
```
##Check if the date is removed
```{r}
user_reviews
```
##Load stopwords 
```{r}
stop_words
```
##Seperate all the words into single entities
```{r}
user_reviews %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = English) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  filter(str_detect(word, "[:alpha:]")) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```
```{r}
review_words <- user_reviews %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = English) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  filter(str_detect(word, "[:alpha:]")) %>%
  distinct()
```

#review the table

```{r}
review_words
```

## Removing unnecessary columns

```{r}
review_words <- review_words %>% select(-Tweet)
review_words <- review_words %>% select(-`Unnamed: 0`)
review_words
```

## Count the number of correlations and word count

```{r}
users_who_mention_word <- review_words %>%
  count(word, name = "users_n", sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(users_n >= 5)

word_correlations <- review_words %>%
  semi_join(users_who_mention_word, by ="word") %>%
  pairwise_cor(item = word, feature = User) %>%
  filter(correlation >= 0.4)
```

## Building a word network plot

```{r}
graph_from_data_frame(d = word_correlations,
                      vertices = users_who_mention_word %>%
                        semi_join(word_correlations, by = c("word" = "item1"))) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = correlation)) +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(color= users_n, label = name), repel = TRUE)
```

## Making the size of the graph bigger

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
graph_from_data_frame(d = word_correlations,
                      vertices = users_who_mention_word %>%
                        semi_join(word_correlations, by = c("word" = "item1"))) %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha = correlation)) +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(color= users_n, label = name), repel = TRUE)
